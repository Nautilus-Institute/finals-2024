# The DEF CON CTF 2024 Finals #

This repository contains the open source release for Nautilus Institute's 2024
DEF CON CTF finals.

We are releasing all of the source code for every challenge that was released
during the game. In most cases, this also includes all of the code required to
build that source code into a working challenge (such as `Makefile`s and
`Dockerfile`s). It *does not* include the infrastructure required to *host*
those challenges (e.g. our CI/CD pipeline, deployment scripts, and the
`gatekeeper` binary that validates tickets).
